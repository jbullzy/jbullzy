- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jack
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in web development, data analytics, machine learning, and performance statistics. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working through The Odin Project to polish basic programming skills. 

- ðŸ“« How to reach me ... bullington.jack@gmail.com

- ðŸ‘£ Outside of programming, I'm putting dirt under my feet for a Marathon in January 2022. 
- ðŸ–¥ My current goal is to build a running dashboard through Garmin's API, as well as make a playlist converter for Apple Music -> Spotify!
